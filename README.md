# Google Music Crawler

Since youtube has released 'Youtube Premium', I had to move my playlist into Youtube music. But they don't support any kind of tools to do that (even though both services are totally same looking and same data(like.. playlist, radio stations)).

This python script (not very kind. You should do all manually.) will extract singer, song title from google music's playlist.

## HOW TO USE

1. go to your google music playlist
2. zoom out as much as you can
3. save html file
4. run script modifying some file name
